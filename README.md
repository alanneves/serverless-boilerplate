# Serverless Boilerplate to API Node.js

This project has been generated using the `aws-nodejs-typescript` template from the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and add new library to optimize dev workflow.

> **Requirements**: NodeJS `lts/fermium (v.14.15.0)`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

### Feature Extra

- GitHub Actions for CD to AWS

### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npx sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

### Development enviroment

- Run `serverless offline --httpPort 8001` to emulate.
- The application will start on [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/)

### 3rd party libraries

- [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) - uses JSON-Schema definitions used by API Gateway for HTTP request validation to statically generate TypeScript types in your lambda's handler code base
- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.Js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
- [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) - plugin emulate [AWS Î»](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway).
